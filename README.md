# UFOs

## Overview of the Project ##
For this project we are supposed to build a HTML page based on the UFO sightings data across United States given a javascript data file. The data pulled from the javascript file is to be shown on the HTML page dynamically meaning, it should have the ability to filter the data based on certain criteria selections.

## Resources ##
Javascript, HTML, Bootstrap and CSS

## Results ##

The HTML page looks as follows :-

Complete data of the UFO sightings has been provided at the bottom of the HTML page. It makes a lot of sense if a filter is provided so that the entire data table can be broken down into smaller and concise parts for better analysis and visualisation. Hence in order to facilitate the filtering of data, various filters have been provided which are dynamic and work independently of the other filters meaning if one filter criteria is applied, then whatever satisfies the filter criteria would be shown on the HTML page. The five different filters given are date, city, state, country and shape (shape of the UFO) as follows :-
