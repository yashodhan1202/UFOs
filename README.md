# UFOs

## Overview of the Project ##
For this project we are supposed to build a HTML page based on the UFO sightings data across United States given a javascript data file. The data pulled from the javascript file is to be shown on the HTML page dynamically meaning, it should have the ability to filter the data based on certain criteria selections.

## Resources ##
Javascript, HTML, Bootstrap and CSS

## Results ##

The HTML page looks as follows :-

Complete data of the UFO sightings has been provided at the bottom of the HTML page. It makes a lot of sense if a filter is provided so that the entire data table can be broken down into smaller and concise parts for better analysis and visualisation. Hence in order to facilitate the filtering of data, various filters have been provided which are dynamic and work independently of the other filters meaning if one filter criteria is applied, then whatever satisfies the filter criteria would be shown on the HTML page. The five different filters given are date, city, state, country and shape (shape of the UFO) as follows :-

## Summary ##

Currently the data that was given to us is based on UFO sightings only from USA. There may have been UFO sightings in the rest of the world. If that data is also included in the base data then providing the filter for country would have made much more sense. If you filter just by country, it would return the exact same data as it is when the page is opened.

Two recommendations are as follows :- 
1) Add data for UFO sightings from around the world to the base data
2) The data currently given can be challenged as there is no data point to validate the claim. If we can have number of people present during the sighting then it would add that extra validity to the claim. Also if the phenomena was recorded the equipment through which it was recorded can also be given to support the claim.
